Build for the Ludum Dare 45 Game Jam
https://ldjam.com/

Note: Please don't try to play on lower resolutions, the UI will not work. Recommended 1920x1080 or larger.

We unfortunately didn't get to add everything we wanted to this game. The progression system is simple, the gameplay is slow, the SFX are lacking, the UI doesn't scale, and so much more. However considering that we only had around 60 hours in our case, since none of us took Monday off of work, I'm proud of what we made here.

Hopefully we'll see this improve over the coming weeks, as we plan to finish this game the way we want once the game jam has completed, but that will be done in a seperate Repository, in order to preserve the build from our Jam.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this, and to the Ludum Dare team for setting this up, it was a blast.
